Is provides a quick, clean and simple framework for writing Go tests.

## Installation

To install, simply execute:

```
go get gopkg.in/tylerb/is.v1
```

I am using [gopkg.in](http://http://labix.org/gopkg.in) to control releases.

## Usage

Using `Is` is simple:

```go
func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
	is := is.New(t)

	expected := 10
	result, _ := awesomeFunction()
	is.Equal(expected,result)
}
```

If you'd like a bit more information when a test fails, you may use the `Msg()` method:

```go
func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
	is := is.New(t)

	expected := 10
	result, details := awesomeFunction()
	is.Msg("result details: %s", details).Equal(expected,result)
}
```
